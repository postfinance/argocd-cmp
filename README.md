# ArgoCD Config Management Plugins (CMP)

This repository includes several [ArgoCD configuration management
plugins](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/config-management-plugins/)

capability of ArgoCD, for example to permit rendering and application `source:`
with Google's `kpt`, with `ytt`, with `jsonnet`, or a combination of templating
tools.
